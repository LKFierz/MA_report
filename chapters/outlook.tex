\section{Resolving Prerequisites}

Before putting together the entire LORNA pipeline shown in \cref{fig:lorna_setup}, the fundamental building blocks need to work well. 

First and foremost, the entire LORNA approach builds upon the foundational depth acquisition using structure from motion. This method needs to work robustly during any lateral motion. Specifically, SFM must be more robust concerning yaw rotations and pitch angles during initialization.

The map-based localization algorithm, which reduces the global drift of the state estimator, is not crucial for this thesis but a necessary component for the LORNA pipeline. This node was still in development at the time of this writing and would need to be ready to finish the whole LORNA mission concept.

\section{Putting together the current pipeline}

Given that SFM works as desired, the pipeline can be put together. 

The state estimator can be combined with LORNA's vision-based pipeline and autonomy framework and deployed on embedded hardware to supply the process with onboard pose estimates rather than ground truth. 

The question of the embedded processor's computational feasibility will arise, and a decision will have to be made about the processing unit.

\section{Expansion on the current approach}

This project endeavors to fly science missions on Mars with onboard state estimation and autonomous landing capabilities. Naturally, this mission could be expanded in various domains to interact more with the environment. However, in the following, I will lay out possible enhancements for this approach in pursuit of the currently pronounced objectives.

\textbf{SFM}

To make the keyframe switch and the associated LSD map movement less radical, it might be beneficial to change the keyframe selection approach to always switch out the keyframes as long as incoming frames are above a certain quality threshold. This would lead to more frequent yet smaller map movements, allowing LSD to retain most of the map at a time and, therefore, many more landing sites.

A possible change to slightly increase computational efficiency and ease of understanding would be to include the stereo camera node within the SFM node. In this case, the laser range finder measurements would decide between the two algorithms to be performed. That way, there is only one depth supplying node that needs to be run during flight.

\textbf{LSD}

As indicated in \cref{sec:eval_LSD}, LSD is currently neglecting most of the information present at high altitudes. An alternative to counteract this would be considering different map sizes at the different layers. That way, the high-resolution layers can retain detailed elevation information at the center of the DEM, while the coarsest layers span a much larger area. When pursuing this implementation, however, the information pooling for DEM consistency across the layers would not be as straightforward.

\textbf{Autonomy}

The modular architecture of the autonomy allows for a manifold of incremental behavior optimizations. A few that come to mind are listed hereafter:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A possible autonomy enhancement is the introduction of path planning capabilities. The detected landing sites indicate flat, benign terrain and could be used as a prior indication of safely traversable terrain. This knowledge could be used to decrease the necessary safety buffer of the clearing altitude and thus save time and energy ascending to excessive heights.
    \item Instead of pursuing a single landing site, clusters of potential sites could be considered for initial deployment. That way, less weight is placed on the first site, which is pursued in favor of an increased chance of detecting a high-quality landing site on the second attempt.
    \item Furthermore, the weighing of the different properties entering the heuristic of a landing site is alterable. This should be used to change the weight distribution of these characteristics depending on the battery level. For instance, the distance to the drone could be weighed higher in case of a low battery level.
\end{itemize}
