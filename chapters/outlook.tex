\section{Putting together the current pipeline}

First and foremost, the entire LORNA approach builds upon the foundational depth acquisition using structure from motion. This method needs to work robustly during any kind of lateral motion.

Given that SFM works as desired, the state estimator can be combined with LORNA's vision based pipeline and deployed on the embedded hardware in order to fly safe long distance science missions on Mars. 

Stereo and SFM could become one node where the laser range finder activates and deactivates the nodes based on the detected altitude.
