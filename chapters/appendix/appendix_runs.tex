\chapter{Appendix: In-depth flight analysis}
\label{sec:specific_runs}

In the following, a detailed flight log is shown for the test setting of spawning at a fixed location on the Arroyo map and flying a random mission at 100 m altitude.

This example shows an ordinary flight where the drone took off from the ground, flew to a mission way point at cruise altitude and attempted to land twice which the second attempt was successful.

\subsection{Landing position}

As for \cref{chapter:evaluation}, the landing attempts are shown in \cref{fig:demo_run_landing}.


The mission way point in this run was quite close to the center. Therefore, it comes to no surprise that a landing site at the start plateau was chosen. One landing site was chosen but not verified and a close by site was subsequently chosen.
