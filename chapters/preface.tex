The purpose of this work is to contribute a small part towards the exploration of Mars and therefore, this universe. 

I'm in awe of the brilliant work achieved by the ingenious people of this field and feel fortunate to be able to work alongside them.

As this work concludes my master's degree at ETH Zurich I feel tremendous pride and gratitude to have been able to study at this phenomenal university and for all the other opportunities I was given throughout my time as a graduate student.
